## Before you Begin 🛠 🔨

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

````
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
$ npm start
````

````
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
$ pnpm start
````

````
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev
$ yarn start
````
